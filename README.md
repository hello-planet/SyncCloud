# SyncCloud
A local client designed for a Cloud Sync Server
The server is based on Lunix/Ubuntu 16.04 and the server application is supported by Tonido inc.
You can easily upload and download files on this C/S frame system.
And it will provide a file synchronization on background aiming to the selected folder in your local PC.
Others can be shared with these files in real time when you revise or make files in that folder.

Before you get access to this service,you need to build a local file server.
Get Tonido installed and get an account stored in your own local server.
